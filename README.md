### Exercise 1:  Classic Hello World:
DESCRIPTION:
You are given a method called main, make it print the line Hello World!, (yes, that includes a new line character at the end) and don't return anything

Note that for some languages, the function main is the entry point of the program.

### Exercise 2:  Collinearity:
Theoretical Material
You are given two vectors starting from the origin (x=0, y=0) with coordinates (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). Your task is to find out if these vectors are collinear. Collinear vectors are vectors that lie on the same straight line. They can be directed in the same or opposite directions. One vector can be obtained from another by multiplying it by a certain number. In terms of coordinates, vectors (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are collinear if (x1, y1) = (k*x2, k*y2) , where k is any number acting as a coefficient.

Notes
All vectors start from the origin (x=0, y=0).
Be careful when handling cases where x1, x2, y1, or y2 are zero to avoid division by zero errors.
A vector with coordinates (0, 0) is collinear to all vectors.
